# MexicoInBlue
A website for a project from Stanford Social Entrepreneurship Program 2019

I was in charge of creating the website itself, and helped my two cofounders with the logo. 

This website does not include any programming, but instead is a demonstration of front end design coding.

To view the website please download, and double click index.html
